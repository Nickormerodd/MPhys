# MPhys
Mphys Project

An Mphys project whereby different cubed data, varying across frequency ranges, is analysed centred around a promising protostar formation.

The ultimate aim is to determine, using moment mapped velocity plots assuming gaussian fitting molecular transition peaks, whether an accretion disk is present.
